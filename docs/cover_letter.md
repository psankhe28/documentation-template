Dear Team,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Mentee position at Hyperledger for the project **"Hyperledger Caliper Documentation Platform Update."** Upon discovering this opportunity, I immediately recognized its potential to enrich my career path.

## Background and Skills
My background in **technical writing** and **documentation**, coupled with a fervent passion for **open-source collaboration** and **blockchain technology**, aligns seamlessly with the objectives of this project. I possess a solid foundation in crafting clear and concise **technical documentation**, refined through previous experiences documenting software projects and active participation in open-source initiatives.

In addition to my proficiency in **markdown** and **documentation frameworks**, I have acquired a comprehensive understanding of **blockchain technology** through academic coursework and practical project development. My hands-on experience with **blockchain principles and applications** equips me well to contribute effectively to the documentation of Hyperledger Caliper. Currently, I am actively exploring Hyperledger Caliper to deepen my understanding of its functionality.

For the past two years, I have been deeply involved in **open-source contributions**, making significant impacts across various organizations, including C2SI, Elixir-cloud-aii, caMicroscope, and meshery. Notably, I was honored to be selected as one of 103 contributors from India for **Code4GovTech**, out of over 44,000 applicants. You can review some of my noteworthy contributions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wBEkEi3NnsYqadQ-ppTVJ_yKFDoHXG21fnzgbOxRt80/edit?usp=sharing).
